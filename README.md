stable (2.5.10) releases of gphoto2 and libGphoto2 based on
[git repositories](https://github.com/gphoto/)

This script was initially created for Raspbian http://www.raspbian.org

Testing script using Docker containers
======================================
In order to test pull requests without touching my OS, I'm using customized Docker images of ubuntu 14.04, debian 7 and debian 8 and raspbian to automatically download and execute that new git branches. Here you can find a complete blog post explaining the thing (in spanish).

http://blog.zoogon.net/2016/03/usando-docker-para-crear-maquinas.html

The main advantage is that everytime you will need it, you will have an updated and clean OS image just with git installed. After every execution the container is destroyed so changes dissappear.

The quick way to create a customized ubuntu 14.04 container:

1.- Install docker (sudo apt-get install docker)

2.- Move to a new folder and create a file named "Dockerfile" with this contents to define your customized container.
```
FROM ubuntu:14.04
RUN apt-get -y update && apt-get install -y git
COPY ./test-script.sh /
```
3.- Create a file named test-script.sh to store the script that docker builder will copy to image to download and execute the desired Git branch.
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
git clone $1
cd gphoto2-updater
./gphoto2-updater.sh
```
4.- Now build your customized image (it will remain stored in your local system)
```
docker build -t ubuntu-14.04-git .
```
5.- Done! 

Now you can test a Git branch everytime you need it over an clean ubuntu 14.04 container just running:
```
docker run --rm -ti ubuntu-14.04-git /test-script.sh [http-url-of-git-branch]
```

Docker will init a fresh ubuntu 14.04 container, clone the git branch of the gphoto and run the gphoto2-updater script. After execution, the rm flag destroys the container.

Similar actions can be done to generate customized debian 7 and debian 8 images. In fact I've created a script to test gphoto2-updater just as follows:
```
./test-os.sh [customized-image] [url-to-git-branch]
```
Example: 
```
./test-os.sh ubuntu-14.04-git https://github.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater.git
```
